Split into 3 Compare Files
Goals - Cards - Corners
Goals = all teams
    X Fine, keep as normal

Cards = Top 5 Leagues
    X Combine Corner/Card pred into predictor google sheets
    -Compare only has top 5 
    X Make teams list to CardsTeams.txt for these teams to paste into Compare for Cards
    X Make leagues list to CardsLeagues.txt for those leagues to check in predictor

Corners = Teams that have corner stats
    X Combine Corner/Card pred into predictor google sheets
    X CheckCorners python script to check which teams have had a game where corners are given as -1
        X Output teams list from CornersLeagues using Fixtures file to CornersTeams.txt for these teams to paste into Compare for Corners
        X Done with teams rather than leagues cause if two teams in a "wrong league" have all stats, they can still be compared
    -Will have to monitor regularly to see if corners are not being tracked

Combine Corner/Card predictor with original predictor
    X If league in CardsLeagues.txt, then run cards predictor
    X If league in CornersLeagues.txt, then run corners predictor
    X Run Goals predictor for every fixture
    
-CHECK Result in excel IF HAVING CORNERS = None in regards to stats. Or setting it to equal -1
    X Change scrape.py to have corners/cards be -1 if not found. Since it could be 0 and helps differentiate

-Write python script to get Leagues in stats for scraping as reference

X Write Stats into one file as normal
X (NEED TO RUN SCRAPE AGAIN FROM AN EMPTY START SINCE I HAVE LOST GAMES)
X (NEED TO CLEAR AllStats.db and change schema)

X Add the Country to the League when Scraped. Can be found above the leagues on Soccerway
    X Format England - Premier League

NEED TO USE OLD COMPARE FILE
X CLEAN UP DIRECTORY
