Split into 3 Compare Files
Goals - Cards - Corners
Goals = all teams
    -Fine, keep as normal

Cards = Top 5 Leagues
    X Combine Corner/Card pred into predictor google sheets
    -Compare only has top 5 
    -CheckCards python script to get Top 5 Leagues
        -Make teams list to CardsTeams.txt for these teams to paste into Compare for Cards
        -Make leagues list to CardsLeagues.txt for those leagues to check in predictor

Corners = Teams that have corner stats
    X Combine Corner/Card pred into predictor google sheets
    -CheckCorners python script to check which leagues have had more than 5 games where corners are given as -1
        -Output teams list from CornersLeagues using Fixtures file to CornersTeams.txt for these teams to paste into Compare for Corners
        -Output leagues list from Fixtures to CornersLeagues.txt for these leagues to check in predictor
    -Will have to monitor regularly to see if corners are not being tracked

Combine Corner/Card predictor with original predictor
    -If league in CardsLeagues.txt, then run cards predictor
    -If league in CornersLeagues.txt, then run corners predictor
    -Run Goals predictor for every fixture
    
-CHECK Result in excel IF HAVING CORNERS = None in regards to stats. Or setting it to equal -1
    -Change scrape.py to have corners/cards be -1 if not found. Since it could be 0 and helps differentiate

-Write python script to get Leagues in stats for scraping as reference

1 Write Stats into one file as normal
(NEED TO RUN SCRAPE AGAIN FROM AN EMPTY START SINCE I HAVE LOST GAMES)
(NEED TO CLEAR AllStats.db and change schema)

Add the Country to the League when Scraped. Can be found above the leagues on Soccerway
    -Format England - Premier League
